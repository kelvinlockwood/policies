4\. FCC’s Obligations as a Processor
----------------------------------------

4.1. **Scope of Processing and Customer Instructions**. FCC will Process the Personal Information on documented instructions from Customer in such manner as is necessary for the provision of the Service under the Agreement, except as may be required to comply with any legal obligation to which FCC is subject.

4.2. **Lawfulness of Instructions.** FCC may make reasonable effort to inform Customer if, in its opinion, the execution of an instruction relating to the Processing of Personal Information could infringe on any Data Protection Laws. In the event FCC must Process or cease Processing Personal Information for the purpose of complying with a legal obligation, FCC will inform the Customer of that legal requirement before Processing or ceasing to Process, unless prohibited by the law.

4.3. **FCC Personnel Confidentiality Obligations**. FCC will grant access to Customer Personal Information to its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for implementing, managing and monitoring the Service. FCC shall ensure that personnel authorized to Process Customer Personal Information have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

4.4. **Security of Processing.** FCC shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of Personal Information including protection against a Data Breach. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, FCC shall implement the technical and organizational measures specified in Schedule II.

4.5. **Data Breach Notification.** FCC shall notify Customer without undue delay in the event of a confirmed Data Breach.

4.6. **GDPR Articles 32-36**.

4.7. **Fulfillment of Data Subject Requests.** FCC shall promptly notify Customer of any request it has received from a Data Subject. FCC shall not respond to the request itself, unless authorized to do so by Customer. FCC shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer in fulfilling its obligations to respond to Data Subject requests to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws.

Customer must sign up at the aforementioned URL to receive email notifications concerning the addition of new Subprocessors. Customer may reasonably object to the addition of any new Subprocessor within 15 calendar days of receiving such email notification, in which case FCC will use reasonable efforts to make a change in the Service or recommend a commercially reasonable change to avoid processing by such Subprocessor. If FCC is unable to provide an alternative, Customer may terminate the Service and shall pay FCC any fees or expenses not yet paid for all services provided pursuant to any Agreement. If Customer fails to sign up for these email notifications, Customer shall be deemed to have waived its right to object to the newly added Subprocessor(s).

6.1. **Scope**. FCC will maintain records of its Processing activities carried out on behalf of Customer and will make available to Customer the information reasonably necessary to demonstrate its compliance with the obligations set out in this DPA. FCC may limit the scope of information made available to Customer if Customer is a FCC competitor, provided that such limitation does not violate Data Protection Laws or the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. Customer’s inspection rights under this DPA do not extend to FCC’s employee payroll, personnel records or any portions of its sites, books, documents, records, or other information that do not relate to the Service or to the extent they pertain to third parties.

6.2. **Process**. Subject to thirty (30) days’ prior written notice from Customer and at the Customer's additional expense (including all reasonable costs and fees for any and all time FCC expends on such audit, in addition to the rates for services performed by FCC), FCC and Customer shall mutually agree to appoint a third-party auditor to verify that FCC is in compliance with the obligations under this DPA. In no event shall the Parties agree to a third-party auditor that is a competitor to FCC. Audits and inspections will be carried out at mutually agreed times during regular business hours. Customer shall be entitled to exercise this audit right no more than once every twelve (12) months. Customer shall not be entitled to an on-site audit of FCC’s premises unless legally required by a Regulator.

6.3. **Confidentiality**. All information obtained during any such request for information or audit will be considered FCC’s Confidential Information under the Agreement and this DPA. The results of the inspection and all information reviewed during such inspection will be deemed FCC’s Confidential Information. The third party auditor may only disclose to Customer specific violations of this DPA, if any, and the basis for such findings, and shall not disclose any of the records or information reviewed during the inspection.

7\. Transfers Outside of EEA, UK, and Switzerland
-------------------------------------------------

To the extent Customer’s use of the Service requires an onward transfer mechanism to lawfully transfer Personal Information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country or territory which has not been formally recognized by the European Commission as affording the Personal Information an adequate level of protection, Customer hereby acknowledges, agrees, and instructs FCC to transfer Customer Personal Information as set forth in Schedule 3 (Cross Border Transfers) of this DPA.

Termination or expiration of this DPA shall not discharge the Parties from their obligations that by their nature may reasonably be deemed to survive the termination or expiration of this DPA.

‍

10\. Limitation of Liability
----------------------------

This DPA shall be subject to the limitations of liability agreed between Customer and FCC in the Agreement and such limitation shall apply in aggregate for all claims under the Agreement and DPA.

‍

11\. Severability
-----------------

Any provision of this DPA that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invaliding the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The Parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon a valid and enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute and shall incorporate such substitute provision into this Agreement.
