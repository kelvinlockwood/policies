# A fair and simple refund policy

## Examples of full refunds we’d grant.

* No questions asked, we'll refund you if you cancel within the first 14 days of the Service.
* If you were just charged for your next Billing period of Service but you meant to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.

## Examples of partial credits we’d grant.

* If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took multiple days to get back to you, we’d issue a partial credit to your account.

## Get in touch

At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to a case-by-case basis. [Send us a note]({{ site.email_support }}), tell us what's up, and we'll work with you to make sure you’re happy.

**This policy applies to FCC's Membership offering.
