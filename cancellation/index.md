# Cancellation policy

*Last updated: September 01, 2023*

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your Subscription directly within your Membership account — no phone calls required, no questions asked.

Account owners can follow these instructions to cancel:
* Navigate to "Account & Billing" from the menu and select "Cancel your subscription". You can continue using your account until your paid period expires and your account is automatically canceled, or you can close it earlier after your subscription is stopped, from the "Account & Billing" section, selecting "Close your account now".

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else.

## What happens when you cancel an account?

You can cancel your subscription and keep using your account until your paid period expires. Then the account will be automatically canceled and will become inaccessible. You can also choose to cancel your account earlier. You won’t be able to access your account once it has been cancelled, so make sure you download everything you want to keep beforehand. 

We’ll permanently delete the content in your account within 60 days after cancellation. **Content can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.**

We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t prorate any unused time you may have left but if you have just started a new billing cycle, contact us for a [fair refund](../refund/index.md). We’ll treat you right.

We retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](../terms/index.md). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](../abuse/index.md).
