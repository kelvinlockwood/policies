## A Note About the Email Addresses

So how come the links don't work in this repository? The short answer is: we made a technical tradeoff. The long answer is, we copy the policies in this repository to our product marketing sites. To make it easier to transfer, we are now using relative links, [this Jekyll plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links) to convert Markdown links to a valid web URL, and some [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) variables.
